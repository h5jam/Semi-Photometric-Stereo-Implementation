# Semi-Calibrated Photometric Stereo Implementation

This repository includes implementation of paper "Semi-Calibrated Photometric Stereo, TPAMI 2020". Photometric stereo is a technique estimating surface normal of object through observation under varying light conditions. "Semi-Calibrated" means light intensities are unknown but the light directions are known.
